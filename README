Welcome
-------

oc2/zcomponents is part of the oc2 (Open Command and Control) framework. It is 
based on the 0MQ lightweight messaging kernel, and is designed to develop fast 
non real-time processing software.

Building and installation
-------------------------

See the INSTALL file included with this distribution.

Resources
---------

Git repository: http://github.com/a-skr/zcomponents

To get sources, use this command:
git clone git://github.com/a-skr/zcomponents.git

Building from git tree
----------------------

The git tree doesn't include autotools generated scripts. You will have to run
the autogen.sh script. The generated ChangeLog file will be empty. It is filled
when the "dist" or "dist-check" targets are called.

Debian package
--------------

oc2/zcomponents is Debian friendly. Execute this command from distribution
top level directory to get debian packages:

dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc

Copying
-------

Free use of this software is granted under the terms of the GNU Lesser General
Public License (LGPL). For details see the files `COPYING` and `COPYING.LESSER`
included with the oc2/zcomponents distribution.

Bugs
----

Unless you generate debian packages from a packaged distribution (obtained with
"make dist"), there will be no changelog.gz file in the packages.
